Sugar 102 Release Notes
=======================

102 has not been released yet.  These notes are work in progress.

Deprecations
------------

### Icon size

In Icon (sugar3.graphics.icon), the `icon_size` parameter has been
deprecated in favour of `pixel_size`.  The latter should be the only
one used.  The reason of the change is that we noticed a regression
when moving to latest GTK+.  GTK+ have deprecated icons sizes in
GtkSettings since version 3.10.

From [GTK+ changelog](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/plain/NEWS?id=3.10.0):

> A number of settings have been deprecated and are ignored now.

By the way, this turns out to be a nice change, because having only
one way to tell the icon size simplifies our API.

#### How to migrate

- replace parameter `icon_size` for `pixel_size`
- for value, use the sizes at style.*ICON_SIZE

Corresponding Values:

- use `style.SMALL_ICON_SIZE` as replacement of `Gtk.IconSize.MENU`,
  `Gtk.IconSize.DND`, `Gtk.IconSize.SMALL_TOOLBAR` and
  `Gtk.IconSize.BUTTON`

- use `style.STANDARD_ICON_SIZE` as replacement of
  `Gtk.IconSize.LARGE_TOOLBAR`

Example:

    -        icon = Icon(icon_size=Gtk.IconSize.MENU, icon_name='media-eject')
    +        icon = Icon(pixel_size=style.SMALL_ICON_SIZE, icon_name='media-eject')
